<p>
  Library of Trans Alexander (LOTA) was born out of a conversation between Alex Avry Denholtz and Rain Dove. In that conversation, they imagined an organization that could serve as a seed silo for transmasculine literature, given what was to come only a few weeks later.
  <br />
  Alex established LOTA that same day, December 26, 2024, in Brooklyn, NY. Since its inception, LOTA has been for transmascs and by transmascs, to serve as a resource for reflection, community building, recognition, and progress.
  <br />
  Similar to our namesake, Library of Alexandria, LOTA accepts any written works-- anything that could be sent on a piece of paper. Therefore, we accept zines, comics, protest materials, lyrics, and more!
  <br />
  We are an archive born out of necessity. It is not a matter of who has the right credentials or experience, but rather what work must be done.

      Anyone can donate to our archive! Broadly speaking, we accept any physical or digital works involving written words by a self-identified transmasculine person. For collaborative projects, we ask that at least 25% of the authors identify as transmasculine. We also accept submissions written pre-transition, for which we can remove, replace, or keep any deadnames. Please see our Data Privacy page for more information.â€‹ You can submit via P.O. Box, e-mail, or in-person in NYC.
