<p>
  Library of Trans Alexander (LOTA) was born out of a conversation between Avry Denholtz and Rain Dove. In that conversation, they imagined an organization that could serve as a seed silo for transmasculine literature, given what was to come only a few weeks later.
  <br />
  Avry established LOTA that same day, December 26, 2024, in Brooklyn, NY. Since its inception, LOTA has been for transmascs and by transmascs, to serve as a resource for reflection, community building, recognition, and progress.
  <br />
  Similar to our namesake, Library of Alexandria, LOTA accepts any written works-- anything that could be sent on a piece of paper. Therefore, we accept zines, comics, protest materials, lyrics, and more!
  <br />
  We are an archive born out of necessity. It is not a matter of who has the right credentials or experience, but rather what work must be done.

      <b>Donation:</b> literature from someone who is not the author. <br />

      Anyone can donate to our archive! Broadly speaking, we accept any physical or digital works involving written words by a self-identified transmasculine person. For collaborative projects, we ask that at least 25% of the authors identify as transmasculine. We also accept submissions written pre-transition, for which we can remove, replace, or keep any deadnames. Please see our Data Privacy page for more information.â€‹ You can submit via P.O. Box, e-mail, or in-person in NYC.

    Beginning in March, we will open the project up to group discussions around certain topics.
