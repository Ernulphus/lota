<p>
  Library of Trans Alexander (LOTA) was born out of a conversation between Alex Avry Denholtz and Rain Dove. In that conversation, they imagined an organization that could serve as a seed silo for transmasculine literature, given what was to come only a few weeks later.
  <br />
  Alex Avry established LOTA that same day, December 26, 2024, in Brooklyn, NY. Since its inception, LOTA has been for transmascs and by transmascs, to serve as a resource for community and reflection.
  <br />
  Similar to our namesake, Library of Alexandria, LOTA accepts any written works-- anything that could be sent on a piece of paper. Therefore, we accept zines, comics, protest materials, lyrics, and more!
  <br />
  We are an archive born out of necessity. It is not a matter of who has the right credentials or experience, but rather what work must be done.

      <b>Donation:</b> literature from someone who is not the author. <br />

      Anyone can donate to our archive! Broadly speaking, we accept any physical or digital works involving written words by a self-identified transmasculine person. For collaborative projects, we ask that at least 25% of the authors identify as transmasculine. We also accept submissions written pre-transition, for which we can remove, replace, or keep any deadnames. Please see our Data Privacy page for more information.â€‹ You can submit via P.O. Box, e-mail, or in-person in NYC. Please copy and paste the following template into an email titled "Submission/Donation" for <a href="libraryoftransalexander@proton.me" target='_blank' rel="noreferrer" >libraryoftransalexander@proton.me.</a> You will receive an email response within 3 business days.

    On February 1st, 2025, the Library of Trans Alexander announced our Oral History project. In this project, interviewees' responses will be transcribed and anonymized. We will collect these interviews into a zine, to be published in the summer.

    Beginning in March, we will open the project up to group discussions around certain topics.
